# MoviesOMDB App

## Overview
This project is an implementation of an app that can search the OMDB (Open Movie Database) for movies. It uses the OMDB API to fetch search results based on user input.

## OMDB API

- Free API key: [OMDB API Key](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)

## Features
- Search for movies using the OMDB API.
- Display search results with movie posters, titles, and years of release.
- Each search result includes a button (non-functional in this implementation).
- Search results are updated dynamically as the user types.

## GitHub Repository
- Repository: [MoviesOMDB](https://github.com/codewithtejs/MoviesOMDB.git)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain a free API key from OMDB API (if you don't have one already) and replace my key in the code with your actual API key.
3. Run the app on a suitable platform or emulator.
4. Enter a search term to retrieve movies from OMDB.

## Note
